This is a first attempt at creating a backbone.js rails generator.

Currently, it is specific to my needs.  It assumes you are using:
* backbone.js
* rails 3
* haml
* hamljs
* jammit with JST packaging for templates
* following the backbone directory set up from CloudEdit: http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example
* jasmine
* sinon.js
